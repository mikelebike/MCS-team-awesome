% TEMPORARY for quick fixes
% CHECK for things we're uncertain about
% 
% POSSIBLE extensions of the code
% 
% [] - having food and predators at the same time in simulation?
% [] - having a preference of staying close to the center of the group?
% [] - evolving predators for sight, speed, eating radius, less noise in
% angle. seeing how prey forces a natural selection pressure on
% predators.
% [] - having more than one predator at once, seeing if they are premiered
% to hunt in packs or alone.
